just few attention about the implemntation:

Firstly, the guidelines were not clear throughout the assignment.
According to how I understood the guidelines, I implemented the program as follows:


I made a Implement of a BufferCleaner that clean the buffer after every Userinput. and in that way the program Meets all
for example:  the input: O124P = 'O' .

the requirements were defined in the assignment.
In addition, because I heared that people mentioned the use of "scanf checking". In addition,i did a scanf check's on the "letter's input.

I wasted a lot of time  by doing  the assigment because there were AL LOT OF updates everyday.
its make me  change the whole code several times.
Please if there is any misunderstanding of the code or it seems that I did not act according to your intent
please contact me and ask me what I meant.

tnx 
ginton & meir.
